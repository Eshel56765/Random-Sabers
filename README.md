Enables random saber selection at the start of every song!
# options
- In-game settings -> Random Sabers -> **Enable Random Sabers** *(Default is true)*: Enables/disables the mod functionality. Disabling the mod will keep the currently selected saber as selected, which you can change as usual through the Custom Sabers menu. 
- In-game settings -> Random Sabers -> **Display Selected Saber** *(default is true)*: Enables/disables showing a floating label containing the name of the current saber at the start of every song.  
- In-game settings -> Random Sabers -> **Enable Saber Menus** *(Default is false)*: Enables/disables the saber submenus. These menus hold a toggle for for every saber currently in the CustomSabers folder. Using these toggles, you can toggle for each saber whether it will be inside the selection pool or not.  
  + The default value for sabers is *true*. This means that without touching the submenus, all existing sabers are in the pool, and new sabers are automatically enabled as well. Sabers that are deleted and redownloaded will keep their previous value.  
- In-game setting -> Random Sabers -> **Set all sabers to** *(Default is [Do nothing])*: This control has three options: 
   - **[Do nothing]**: Keeping it at do nothing will not affect your pool. 
   - **Enable all**: Setting this control to "Enable all" or and hitting "Apply" or "OK" will set every existing saber to *enabled* in your selection pool. 
   -  **Disable all**:  Setting this control to "Enable all" or and hitting "Apply" or "OK" will set every existing saber to *disabled* in your selection pool.
